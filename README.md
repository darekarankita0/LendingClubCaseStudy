# Lending Club Case Study
> A consumer finance company specializes in providing loans to urban customers. Loan approval decisions are critical, as they involve two key risks:
Loss of business if reliable applicants are rejected.
Financial loss if risky applicants, who are likely to default, are approved.
The company aims to identify patterns in customer and loan attributes that indicate the likelihood of default. This insight will help in making informed decisions, such as denying loans, adjusting loan amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates to mitigate risk.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Project Background
  
  In the financial lending industry, organizations like banks, credit unions, and fintech companies provide loans to individuals and businesses. These institutions encounter challenges such as deciding loan eligibility, predicting defaults, and managing risk. Our goal is to tackle these issues through a data-driven approach.
- Business problem

  Loan defaults pose a major challenge for lenders, affecting their profitability and financial stability. This case study explores critical factors influencing including interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and grade. By analyzing these variables, we aim to identify patterns that can enhance risk management and optimize loan decision-making.
  
- Dataset Details

  We are using loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011


## Conclusions
- The highest loan is issued to the income group 50K-100K USD. We can clearly see if the annual income is high, there are very less number of defaulters.
- California (CA) has the highest count, indicating it might be the state with the most loans/customers. Illinois (IL) has the lowest count among the states listed.
- The maximum number customer have DTI between 10 to 24. Customers where DTI is between 25 to 30 have less occurrence of defaulters
